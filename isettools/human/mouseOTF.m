% Reference and discussion
%
% We build the otf by first using Hopkins' formula of an eye with only
% defocus and chromatic aberration.  Then, we multiply in an estimate of
% the other aberrations.  At present, we are using some data from Dave
% Williams and colleagues measured using double-pass and threshold data.  
%
% Williams et al. (19XX) predict the measured MTF at the infocus wavelength by 
% multiplying the diffraction limited OTF by a weighted exponential.  
% We perform the analogous calculation at every wavelength.  That is, we
% multiply the aberration-free MTF at each wavelength by the weighted
% exponential in the Williams measurements.  Speaking with Dave last month,
% he said his current experimental observations confirmed that this was
% an appropriate correction.  (BW 05.24.96).
%
% As a further simplification, the human measurements are all 1D.  We build
% a 1D function and then we assume that the true function is circularly
% symmetric.  That is how we fill in the full 2D MTF.  We call it an OTF
% and assume there is no phase shift ...  All an approximation, but
% probably OK for these types of calculations.  Further details could be
% sought out in the recent papers from the Spanish group (e.g. Artal) and
% from Williams and the other Hartmann Shack people.

%
% Note : The article talks about ametropia, whereas the code talks about
% defocus. Both are a problem of focus out of the focal plane, and both are
% in diopters, so I'm guessing they're the same thing.
