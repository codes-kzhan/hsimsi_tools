%
% (ISA means image sensor array.  We usually use "sensor" now.)
%
% The spatial samples in the signal current density image (scdi) are
% represented on a grid determined by the optical image sampling.  This
% routine regrids the scdi spatial samples into the spatial sample
% positions of the sensor pixels.
%
% Both the scdi (and OI) and the sensor samples are specified in units of
% microns. This routine linearly interpolates the scdi samples to a grid
% where integer values correspond to the spatial sample positions of the
% sensor pixels.  The routine uses Matlab's interp1 routine.
%    
% This regridding of the representation is needed to calculate the overlap
% of the signal with the photodector, which only occupies a fraction of the
% pixel area. 
%
% The input arguments are the signal current density image (scdi), optical
% image (oi), sensor and the spacing of the interpolated image that is
% returned (flatSCDI).  
%
% In earlier versions of ISET, we used very high sampling resolution
% (spacing = 0.2, meaning we represented the flatSCDI so that there were 25
% samples within the area of each pixel).  That was slow and did not
% significantly add to the precision.  So around 2002, we shifted to a
% default spacing of 1 (see the routine spatialIntegration).  It is
% possible, however, to set the spacing from the GUI to a finer spacing.
%
% flatSCDI: the resampled signal current density image. 
% newRows and newCols: the spatial positions, in meters, of the sampled
%      points, where (0,0) is the center of the image sensor array.
