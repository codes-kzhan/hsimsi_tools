function outSensor = sensorCompute(sensor,oi,showBar)
%Compute sensor response using sensor parameters and optical image data
%
%   inSensor = sensorCompute([sensor],[oi],[showBar = 1])
%
%  This  top-level function  combines the parameters of an image sensor
%  array (sensor) and an optical image (oi) to produce the sensor volts
%  (electrons).
%
% Inputs
%    sensor:   Image sensor, possibly an array of sensors
%    oi:       Optical irradiance data
%    showBar:  Show waitbar if 1, default is off (0)
%
%  On return the voltage data are stored in the sensor.
%
% Return
%    outSensor: Image sensor containing the data.  Possibly an array.
%
%  The computation checks a variety of parameters and flags in the sensor
%  structure to perform the calculation.  These parameters and flags can be
%  set either through the graphical user interface (sensorImageWindow) or
%  by scripts.
%
%  One of the most important flags is the noise flag.  In general, the
%  sensorCompute includes photon and electrical noise in the computation.
%  It can be useful to run the calculation without any noise, or with
%  photon noise only.  To achieve this set the flag as follows:
%
%    sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'noise flag',0);   % No noise
%    sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'noise flag',1);   % Photon only
%    sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'noise flag',0);   % Photon and electrical
%
%
% COMPUTATIONAL OUTLINE:
%
%   This routine provides an overview of the algorithms.  The specific
%   algorithms are described in the routines themselves.
%
%   1. Handle exposure: autoExposure (or not).
%   2. Compute the mean image: sensorComputeImage()
%   3. Etendue calculation
%   4. Noise, analog gain, clipping, quantization
%   5. Correlated double-sampling
%   6. Handle macbeth management
%
%  The value of showBar determines whether the waitbar is displayed to
%  indicate progress during the computation.
%
% See also:  sensorComputeNoise, sensorAddNoise
%
% Key computational flags:
%
%   Exposure Duration
%   Noise calculations
%
% Examples:
%   sensor = sensorCompute;   % Use selected sensor and oi
%   tmp = sensorCompute(vcGetObject('sensor'),vcGetObject('oi'),0);
%
%  Or, compute with specific sensors
%   scene = sceneCreate; scene = sceneSet(scene,'hfov',4);
%   oi = oiCreate; sensor = sensorCreate;
%   oi = oiCompute(oi,scene); sensor = sensorCompute(sensor,oi);
%   vcAddAndSelectObject(sensor); sensorWindow('scale',1);
