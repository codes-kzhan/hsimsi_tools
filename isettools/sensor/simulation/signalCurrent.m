function signalCurrentImage = signalCurrent(OI,ISA,wBar)
% Compute the signal current at each pixel position
%
%      signalCurrentImage = signalCurrent(opticalImage,ISA,wBarHandles)
%
%  The signal current is computed from the optical image (OI) and the image
%  sensor array properties (ISA). The units returned are charge/pixel/sec. 
%
%  This is a key routine called by sensorCompute.
%  The routine can compute the current in either the default spatial
%  resolution mode (1 spatial sample per pixel) or in a high-resolution
%  made in which the pixel is modeled as a grid of sub-pixels and we
%  integrate the spectral irradiance field across this grid, weighting it
%  for the light intensity and the pixel.  
%  
%  The default or high-resolution mode computation is governed by the
%  nSamplesPerPixel parameter in the sensor 
%
%        sensorGet(sensor,'nSamplesPerPixel');  
%
%  The default mode has a value of 1.  High resolution modes can be
%  computed with sensor = sensorSet(sensor,'nSamplesPerPixel',5) or some
%  other value.  If 5 is chosen, then there is a 5x5 grid placed over the
%  pixel to account for spatial sampling.
%
%  wBar is the handle to the waitbar image.
