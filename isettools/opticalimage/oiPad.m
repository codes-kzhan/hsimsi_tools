function oi = oiPad(oi,padSize,sDist,direction)
%Pad the oi irradiance data with zeros, usually prior to applying OTF
%
%     oi = oiPad(oi,padSize,[sDist],direction)
%
% For optics calculations we need to pad the size (to avoid edge wrapping).
% Here we pad the spatial dimensions with 0s. By changing the row and
% column numbers, we also must and adjust some parameters, such as the
% horizontal field of view accordingly.
%
% You can set the argument direction = 'both','pre', or 'post' to pad both
% or only on one side. By default, the zero-padding takes place on all
% sides of the image.  Thus,  by default if padSize(1) is 3, we add 3 rows
% on top and bottom (total of 6 rows).
%
% Example:
%   oi = oiPad(oi,[8,8,0]);
