%Interpolate optics OTF for shift-invariant calculation in optical image
% 
%  [OTF2D,fSupport] = customOTF(oi,[fSupport],[wavelength = :],[units='mm'])
%
% In the shift-invariant optics model, custom data are stored in the
% optics.OTF slot.  This routine reads the otf data and interpolates them
% to the fSupport and wavelength of the optical image or optics structure.
%
% The returned OTF is normalized so that all energy is transmitted (i.e.,
% the DC value is 1).  This is done by normalizing the peak value to one.
% If we ever have a case when the peak is other than the DC, we have a
% problem with energy conservation - where did the photons go?
%
% The units for the frequency support are cycles/millimeters.  
% Perhaps we should add a 'units' input argument here.

% This is the representation of the OTF
% The units should be specified and optional; we are using mm for
% now.  We can run into trouble if the values of fx or fy exceed those in X
% and Y.  This produces NaNs in the interpolated OTF2D, below.  We could
% check conditions on these variables:
%   max(abs(X(:))), max(abs(fx(:)))
%   max(abs(fy(:))), max(abs(Y(:)))
% I would like to replace the opticsGet here with an oiGet call with
% frequencySupport.  There are some inconsistencies that I don't understand
% and we have to clarify.
