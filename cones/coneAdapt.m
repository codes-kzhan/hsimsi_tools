%% Cone adaptation
%
%   [sensor, adaptedData] = coneAdaptation(sensor, typeAdapt, varargin)
%
% Implement adaptation models to produce the cone volts. Cone absorption
% sampels should be computed and stored in sensorGet(sensor, volts).
%
% The mean level is determined as a reference so that increments and
% decrements are meaningful. This is needed so that on- and off-cells can
% work. When we have a cone absorption that is above the mean, this should
% cause an off-cell to reduce its firing rate and on-cell to increase.
% Conversely, cone absorptions below the mean cause an on-cell to decrease
% and an off-cell to increase.
%
% The discussion in Rodieck book - The first steps in seeing - p. 177 and
% thereabouts for ideas about cone signals. The physiological question is
% what is the meaning of the offset or zero mean. Rodieck describes the
% effect of light as setting the mean transmitter release. In the dark,
% there is a relatively large dynamic range. As the light is on steadily,
% the release decreases and the range available for another flash. If you
% darken from the mean, the rate can increase.
%
% In addition to Rodieck's discussion, there are famous papers by Boynton
% (e.g. adaptation in cones) expressing such a model based on cone ERPs.
%
% The other issue is the total gain.  The cones can only modulate over a
% dynamic range around the mean.  So, we set the gain as well to keep the
% modulation within some range, such as +/- 40 mV of the mean (deplorizing
% voltage).
%
% The third issue is whether all the cones are the same, or there is
% space-variant adaptation. We now here consider the difference between
% different cone types, but we think it's spatial invariant.
%
% Inputs:
%  sensor     - ISETBio sensor with cone absorption computed and stored
%  typeAdapt  - The adaptation model, meaning of value are as below
%           0 = no adaptation
%           1 = a single gain map for the whole cone array
%           2 = one gain map computed for each cone class
%           3 = non-linear adaptation
%           4 = cone adaptation by physiological differential equation
%               (Rieke)
%  params     - Cone adaptation parameters, could include
%    .bgVolts = background voltage
%    .vSwing  = maximum volts response
%
%
% Output:
%   sensor      - ISETBio sensor with cone adaptation parameters set. The
%                 parameters include gain and offset. You could retrieve
%                 the adaptation parameters and data by sensorGet function
%                 calls.
%   adaptedData - Adapted voltage 3D matrix, would be in same size as volts
%                 image in sensor.
%
% Notes:
%   In the future, we will look at the time series and have a time-varying
%   adaptation function. Generally, cones take 200ms and rods take 800ms
%   for adaptation.
%
% Examples:
%   scene = sceneCreate; oi = oiCreate; oi = oiCompute(oi,scene);
%   sensor = sensorCreate('human'); sensor = sensorCompute(sensor,oi);
%
%   sensor = coneAdapt(sensor, 1);
%   adaptedData = sensorGet(sensor, 'adapted volts');
%   gain = sensorGet(sensor, 'adaptation gain');
%   offset = sensorGet(sensor, 'adaptation volts');
%
%   sensor = coneAdapt(sensor,4);  % Rieke model 
%   v = sensorGet(sensor,'volts');

        % Reference:
        %   Felice A. Dunn, et al. Light adaptation in cone vision involves
        %   switching between receptor and post-receptor sites,
        %   doi:10.1038/nature06150
        % From there and some other papers, we know two facts:
        %   1) The steady state response follows:
        %      R/R_max = 1/(1 + (I_{1/2}/I_B)^n)
        %   2) The cone adaptation follows
        %      AMP/AMP_{dark} = ((a + bI_B)/(a + I_B))/(cI_B+1)
        % To compute the adapted voltage for input I on background I_B, we
        % use the following process
        %   1) Compute steady state response for I as R_i
        %   2) Compute dark adapted response for I as R_i * AMP / AMP{dark}
        %   3) Compute I_B adapted response
        %
        % Notes:
        %   In the original paper, the formulas are only tested and fitted
        %   for L cones. Here, we use it for all cone types and this might
        %   lead to simulation errors.
        %
        %   Also, by this method, the adapted cone volts are still positive
        %   This is different from the previous two method
