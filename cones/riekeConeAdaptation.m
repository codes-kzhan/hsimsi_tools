function [cur] = riekeConeAdaptation(stimulus)
% Functional form of rieke cone adaptation model based on UW code.
%
% This function is temporary and for exploration ... See notes below
%
% Example:
%  stimulus = zeros(1,1000); stimulus(100:105) = 70000;
%  [cur] = riekeConeAdaptation(stimulus);
%  vcNewGraphWin; plot(cur); grid on

%% Programming Notes
%
% The initial m-file from UW (s_fredConeModel.m) had two sections that
% computed the current from the stimulus.  The formulae in the two sections
% differed at a key step - the computation of the current.  
%
% One group had computation as:
%
%   cur = -cgmp2cur * g.^h * 2 ./ (2 + cslow ./ cdark);
%
% The second had the computation as:
%
%   cur = -cgmp2cur * g.^h ./ (1 + cslow ./ cdark);
%
% There is a '2' that differs.  We don't know which is right.
% 
% Also, the second calculation in the original confounded the stimulus
% creation with the differential equations, making that form of the
% implementation highly specialized and not useful for general calculation.
%
% Finally, the powerpoint description of the differential equations was not
% precisely the same as either of the calculations in s_fredConeModel.  So,
% that needs to be sorted out also.
%
% The formulae on the slide look like this, and they are implemented in the
% riekeAdaptTemporal.  See the document uploaded by HJ for the derivation
% of the formula. There are a couple of differences.  In particular one
% difference is in how cur2ca is calculated (p.q). HJ says the slides
% resolve to this formula
%
%   q    = 2 * beta * cdark / (k * gdark^h);  % This is cur2ca
%
% but the s_fredConeModel has this formula
%
%   cur2ca = beta * cdark / (cgmp2cur * gdark^3);
%
%
% This function is intended to serve as a basis for discussion as we
% explore the calculations and resolve the differences.  In the end, we
% will use this to settle on the implementation in riekeAdaptTemporal.m.
