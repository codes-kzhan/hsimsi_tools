vsetCalibration
===============

Test numerical accuracy of the VSET functions, comparing VSET values with other sources.

We have a Delori-Webb comparison based on Ed Pugh's suggestions.

There are multiple checks with PsychToolbox in WavefrontOptics.  Some of these might
be moved here.

Then there should be some formula checking, such as Poisson random number generator.
