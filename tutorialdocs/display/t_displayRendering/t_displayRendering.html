% load cmatch/monitorGam
XYZ = ieReadSpectra('XYZ',wave);

%% Load in the surface reflectances of the Macbeth ColorChecker.
% Also, we know the color appearance of a few of them so let's

macbethChart = ieReadSpectra('macbethChart',wave);

% Ooops ... these numbers aren't right.  Must find proper chip numbers
greenChip = 7; redChip = 11; whiteChip = 4; grayChip = 12;

% There are 24 surfaces, so we prepare a small matrix (6 by 4) with 24
% entries. Later, we will use this matrix to display the 24 surfaces.
% The way we will do the display is to build a colormap with 24
% rows.  Each row will describe the (r,g,b) values for one surface.
macbethImage = reshape(1:24,4,6);

% We can't display a pure surface.  We always need to display a
% surface under a particular light.  Hence, an important thing to
% remember during this rendering exercise is that we have chosen
% a particular light.  Later, you might come back to this point
% and load in a different choice for a light.
%
% For now, load in the D65 illuminant and call it the lgt.
lgt = ieReadSpectra('D65',wave);

%% Render the surfaces for the monitor using the XYZ color matching functions
%
% First, compute the XYZ values of the macbeth colorchecker
% under the default illuminant.  These values describe how the
% human visual system will encode the light reflected from each
% of the surfaces.  You should check that this calculation makes
% sense to you by writing it out as a matrix tableau.  Note the
% use of the diag() function ....
macbethXYZ = XYZ'* diag(lgt)* macbethChart;

% Here, we determine the linear RGB settings we will need in
% order to create the same XYZ values on the default monitor.
% Your monitor may not be the same, of course.
macbethLinearRGB = inv(XYZ'*phosphors)*macbethXYZ;

% Now, we haven't set any absolute units for this match.  For
% example, we don't know what the absolute intensity of the light
% source is.  In general, we can't match absolute intensities
% very well across viewing conditions.  For example, if the
% surface is outdoors the outdoor light intensity is several
% orders of magnitude greater than the possible output of the
% monitor.
%
% So, we are going to ignore the absolute intensities.  Instead,
% we are simply going to assume that the white surface will be
% the brightest element of the image.  Consequently, we are going
% to scale the RGB values so that the white surface
% corresponds to the largest displayable value.
%
% We are representing the relationship between the linear RGB
% values and the RGB values in the frame-buffer using a look-up
% table that accounts for for the monitor nonlinearity.  This
% lookup table stores the inverse gamma function, and we have
% called it monitorInvGam (both here and in other tutorials).
% So, let's scale the RGB values so that they fall within the
% range set by that table. 
maxQ = size(monitorInvGam,1);
macbethLinearRGB = round(maxQ*macbethLinearRGB/(max(macbethLinearRGB(:))));

% Now, we are going to use a trick that people often do REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH just a
% trick, no deep principles here REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH for setting the absolute
% levels.  We are going to assume that:  THE WHITE SURFACE XYZ
% should correspond to the MONITOR DISPLAY AT [255,255,255].
% This is not exactly right.  In fact, it is not right at all.
% If you have good calibration methods, you don't need to do
% this.  But, people rarely have good calibration methods so they
% do this.  Let's carry on, though we will talk about this in class.

% Here are the RGB settings for the white chip
wht = macbethLinearRGB(:,whiteChip);

% Scale ALL of the RGB values so that the white chip has a
% framebuffer value that is roughly in the (1,1,1) vector
% direction. 
macbethLinearRGB = diag( (1 ./ wht )  ) * macbethLinearRGB;
macbethLinearRGB = ieScale(macbethLinearRGB,1,maxQ);

% Correct for the monitor nonlinearity.
macbethRGB =  monitorInvGam(round(macbethLinearRGB));

% There are 24 chips, and we have computed the proper display
% intensities for each one of them.  We place an image that
% consists of the list of values 1:24, into the frame-buffer.  We
% set the color table values to the proper r,g,b values.
macbethColorMap = macbethRGB'/max(macbethRGB(:));

% Now, we put up this 6 x 4 matrix and set the image to have the
% right color map.
figure; colormap(macbethColorMap)
image(macbethImage); axis image

% Voila.

 
%% Doing the match when you only know the RGB values
%
% Now, suppose that you don't know very much about either the
% display or, say, a digital camera that you used to acquire the
% data you want to display.  What do you do?
%
% Here, we are going to make some simulated rgb data from a
% digital camera.  The strategy we will use to match the display
% and the original image is to MEASURE THE DISPLAY OUTPUT WITH
% THE DIGITAL CAMERA.  Then, we will try to adjust the display
% output so that it causes the same RGB signal at the camera as
% the original macbeth Color Checker image.

% Once again, we compute the color signal from the color checker
% under some light.
colorSignal = diag(lgt)*macbethChart;
figure; plot(wave,colorSignal)

% For this simulation, we calculate the expected camera rgb
% signals from each of the color signals.
sensors = ieReadSpectra('camera', wave);
cameraRGB = sensors'* colorSignal;

% Next, we need to know how the camera would respond to light
% from each of the monitor phosphors.  This will permit us to
% build a matrix that converts from the linear monitor
% intensities to the camera RGB responses.  We will call this
% matrix mon2camera.  This will be a 3 x 3 matrix.  The first
% column describes the RGB values when the red phoshor is on, the
% second and third when the green and blue are on respectively.
%
% Experimentally, we could obtain these values just by taking a
% camera picture of the monitor.  For example, suppose we just
% turn on the red phosphor, and we use the camera to take a
% picture of the red phosphor.
%
% In this case, though, we know the sensors.  So, rather than
% asking you to do the experiment (but do it if you would like).
% However, given that we know the sensors, we can compute this
% matrix simply as:
mon2camera = sensors'*phosphors;

% This tells us how to set the monitor (linear) RGB values in
% order to match a set of (linear) CAMERA RGB values.  N.B.  The
% human eye is not involved in this calculation.  We are
% adjusting the monitor output so that the camera will have the
% same responses.  There is no mention of people, CIE standards,
% or the like in any of this calculation.
camera2mon = inv(mon2camera);

% We now use the matrix camera2mon to compute the display rgb
% values
macbethCameraLinearRGB = camera2mon*cameraRGB;

% Again, to make a decent picture we will need to correct for
% the framebuffer nonlinearity.  And, we don't really have
% much choice about the absolute intensity of various quantities.
% So, let's perform the same set of calculations we did before in
% order to render a display.

macbethCameraLinearRGB = ...
    round(1000*macbethCameraLinearRGB/(max(macbethCameraLinearRGB(:)))); 

% Because we don't really know the properties of this display, we
% are going to arrange things so that the known white chip is
% displayed as the white of the monitor.  This is a cheap trick
% that often makes people and managers happy.
%
wht = macbethCameraLinearRGB(:,whiteChip);

macbethCameraLinearRGB = diag( (1 ./ wht )  ) * macbethCameraLinearRGB;
macbethCameraLinearRGB = ieScale(macbethCameraLinearRGB,1,size(monitorInvGam,1));
macbethCameraRGB =  monitorInvGam(round(macbethCameraLinearRGB));

% There are 24 chips, and we have computed the proper display
% intensities for each one of them.  We place an image that
% consists of the list of values 1:24, into the frame-buffer.  We
% set the color table values to the proper r,g,b values.
% 
macbethCameraColorMap = ieScale(macbethCameraRGB,0,1)';
figure; colormap(macbethCameraColorMap)
image(macbethImage); axis image

%% Compare the linear rgb values we use are doing the match the two different ways.
figure, clf
plot(macbethCameraColorMap(:,1),macbethColorMap(:,1),'ro'), hold on
plot(macbethCameraColorMap(:,2),macbethColorMap(:,2),'go'), hold on
plot(macbethCameraColorMap(:,3),macbethColorMap(:,3),'bo'), hold off
axis equal, axis square, grid on

% Finally, here is a display with the two images next to one another.
figure
bothMap = [macbethColorMap; macbethCameraColorMap];
colormap(bothMap)

subplot(2,1,1)
image(macbethImage); axis image
title('Matches for Eye')

subplot(2,1,2)
image(macbethImage+24); axis image
title('Matches for Camera')
