%% Computing XYZ values of a monitor
%
% We must measure the main functions that define the color properties of
% any display: these are the phosphor spectral power distributions (SPDs).
% We measure these functions using a spectral radiometer, a device that
% measures the power per nanometer emitted by the display.
%
% The spectral power distributions of a monitor in the Wandell lab,
% measured when the monitor display intensity was set to full value, are
% stored in the corresponding display object.  We extract the phosphor
% spectral power distributions.
d = displayCreate('CRT-Dell');
wavelength = displayGet(d, 'wave');
dWave = wavelength(2) - wavelength(1); % wavelength bin size
phosphors  = displayGet(d, 'spd primaries');

% plot spectral power distribution
vcNewGraphWin; plot(wavelength,phosphors(:,3:-1:1))
xlabel('Wavelength (nm)'), ylabel('Intensity')
title('Spectral Power Distribution of Example Monitor');
set(gca, 'xlim', [350 750]); grid on;

%  To measure the XYZ values of these phosphors, we load in the xbar,ybar,
%  zbar functions defined by the CIE. These are stored in the columns
%  of a matrix, called xyz.mat
XYZ = ieReadSpectra('XYZ',wavelength);

vcNewGraphWin; plot(wavelength, XYZ);
xlabel('Wavelength (nm)'); ylabel('Responsivity');
legend('xbar', 'ybar', 'zbar'); title('CIE XYZ Functions');
set(gca,'xlim',[350 750]); grid on

% Now, we can compute the (X,Y,Z) values of each of the phosphors by
% multiplying the phosphor matrix times the xyz matrix. Notice that the
% phosphors are in the columns of the matrix on the right, and the
% xbar,ybar,zbar functions are in the rows of the matrix on the left.
maxXYZ = 683 * XYZ' * phosphors * dWave;

% The luminance of each phosphor is given by the Y values. The maximum
% value is when the phosphors are set to maximum intensity
disp(['Max luminance of phosphors: ' num2str(maxXYZ(2,:))]);

% The total luminance the display can reach, with all three phosphors on,
% is given by the sum of these three values, 100 cd/m^2 is a typical
% luminance level for monitors.
disp(['Total luminance:' num2str(sum(maxXYZ(2,:)))]);

% A simple way to compute XYZ from spectrum is using function
% ieXYZFromEnergy
maxXYZ = ieXYZFromEnergy(phosphors', wavelength)';

%% Using the CMFs to Match a target (linear display, gamma = 1)
%  Suppose that you send a space ship to the surface of Mars. The spaceship
%  sends back a measurement of a spectral power distribution. Let's load
%  it up.
%
% ieReadSpectrum adjusts the wavelength sampling stored in the file to
% match what we pass it.  In this case, it extrapolate the value at long
% wavelength as zeros
marsSPD = ieReadSpectra('marsspectrum', wavelength);

vcNewGraphWin; plot(wavelength, marsSPD, 'r-')
set(gca,'ylim',[0 1]); grid on;
xlabel('wavelength (nm)'); ylabel('Intensity');
title('Spectral Power Distribution measurement from Mars');

% Now, how do we set the monitor intensities so that what we see on a
% display is a visual match to the spectrum measured on Mars?  We use the
% XYZ color-matching functions. First, measure the values for the Martian
% spectrum
marsXYZ = ieXYZFromEnergy(marsSPD', wavelength);

% Now, recall that the monitor color properties are determined by the
% relative intensity of the outputs of the monitor phosphor SPDs. Suppose
% these intensities are [r,g,b]'. Then the monitor output is
% phosphors*[r,g,b]'. For example, when the red phosphor only is on the
% spectrum is
vcNewGraphWin;
plot(wavelength, phosphors*[1 0 0]', 'r-');
xlabel('wavelength(nm)'); ylabel('Intensity')
title('SPD of Red Phosphor');

% When the red and blue are on, the output is
plot(wavelength, phosphors*[1 0 1]','m-');
xlabel('wavelength(nm)'); ylabel('Intensity')
title('SPD of Red and Blue Phosphors Combined');

% To find the relationship between the [r,g,b] values and the monitor XYZ
% outputs, we only need to multiply the output times the XYZ functions.
% Hence, there is a matrix that maps the linear monitor intensities into
% the XYZ values.  This matrix is
mon2XYZ = ieXYZFromEnergy(phosphors', wavelength); %#ok

% Or we can use
mon2XYZ = displayGet(d, 'rgb2xyz');

% Take a look at this matrix and think about its entries.  Notice that the
% first column contains the XYZ values associated with the red phosphor,
% the middle with the green, and the third column is associated with the
% blue. These values should make sense to you given the shapes of the XYZ
% functions we have already plotted.

% Now, to represent the Martian spectrum on our display, we need to compute
% only one more thing.  How do we set the [r,g,b] values when we know the
% XYZ values of the spectrum?  For this, we need a matrix that converts XYZ
% to monitor linear gun intensities, the inverse of the matrix that we
% have.  So, we calculate this new matrix as
marsRGB = mon2XYZ \ marsXYZ(:);

% The spectrum we should display, therefore, is equal to
vcNewGraphWin;
subplot(2,1,1); plot(wavelength, phosphors * marsRGB)
title('Output SPD of the monitor');
xlabel('wavelength(nm)'); ylabel('Intensity')

% This will be a visual match to the spectrum
subplot(2,1,2) 
plot(wavelength,marsSPD);
title('SPD of original martian image');
xlabel('wavelength(nm)');ylabel('Intensity')

% The principles are the same when we make a match on a normal monitor. The
% only difference, which is reviewed below, is that the frame-buffer
% entries and the intensity of the phosphor output are a nonlinearly
% related. Hence, we must set the frame-buffer entries so that we obtain
% the linear intensity outputs we have just calculated.  This process is
% called gamma correction.

%% Nonlinearity in display - Gamma table and inverse gamma table
%
% The relationship between the intensity emitted by a CRT phosphor and the
% frame-buffer value is generally a nonlinear function. An example of the
% function relating frame-buffer value to emitted light intensity is shown
% here.

% We pull the measured gamma functions out of the display object. This
% particular one was measured at a small number of levels.  Go figure.
monitorGam = displayGet(d, 'gamma');
nLevels = size(monitorGam,1);

vcNewGraphWin;
plot(1:nLevels,monitorGam(:,1)); grid on;
xlabel('Frame buffer');  ylabel('Emitted intensity of red phoshor');
title('Display Red "Gamma" function')

% This is called the "gamma" function of the display. The reason for this
% title is that the function is roughly a simple power function and the
% exponent has historically been called "gamma." Here is a comparison of
% the gamma function of the red phosphor and a power function with an
% exponent of 2.2, the most common value.
vcNewGraphWin;
frameBuffer = 1:nLevels;
pred = ((frameBuffer)/nLevels).^(2.2);
plot(frameBuffer,pred,'k-',frameBuffer,monitorGam(:,1),'r-')
xlim([0 256]); xlabel('Frame buffer'); ylabel('Intensity');
title('Comparison of Power function and red phosphor emission')
legend('y = x^2^.^2', 'Red phosphor','Location', 'NorthWest');
grid on

% For grins, you can see that the fit is different using a larger exponent.
vcNewGraphWin;
frameBuffer = 1:nLevels;
pred = ((frameBuffer)/nLevels).^(2.7);
plot(frameBuffer,pred,'k-',frameBuffer,monitorGam(:,1),'r-')
xlim([0 256]); xlabel('Frame buffer'); ylabel('Intensity');
title('Comparison of Power function and red phosphor emission')
legend('y = x^2^.^7', 'Red phosphor','Location', 'NorthWest');
grid on

% Recall that we measured the emitted intensity using the maximum
% framebuffer value.  This corresponds to the column entries in phosphor,
% and these are the signals emitted when the relative intensity is one.

% To specify the intensity of the emitted light for any given frame-buffer
% level, we can use the simple gamma function.  For example, the spectral
% power distribution of the light emitted by the green phosphor at a frame
% buffer level of 130 is
vcNewGraphWin;
emitted = phosphors(:,2)*monitorGam(130,2);
plot(wavelength,emitted), grid on
xlabel('Wavelength')
ylabel('Intensity')
title('SPD of Green Phosphor at fb = 130');

% Frequently, we are interested in how to set the frame-buffer level in
% order to obtain a given linear output intensity.  To determine this, we
% must calculate the inverse of the "gamma" function.  If we have fit a
% simple polynomial to the gamma function, then we can calculate the
% frame-buffer setting by inverting the function.  So that given a linear
% intensity, l, we can calculate the frame-buffer value as frame-buffer =
% l^(1/gamma).
vcNewGraphWin;
intensity = 0:.001:1;
predFB = intensity.^(1/2.2);
plot(intensity,predFB)
xlabel('Intensity'); ylabel('Frame buffer level');
title('Power Gamma Function Inverse');
grid on

% Another way to perform this calculation is by creating a look-up table
% that inverts the gamma function. Here is the ISETBIO way to do this.
vcNewGraphWin;
invGamTable = ieLUTInvert(monitorGam);
nTableLevels = size(invGamTable, 1);
plot((1:nTableLevels)/nTableLevels,invGamTable/max(invGamTable));
grid on; xlabel('Relative intensity'); ylabel('Frame buffer level');
title('Calibration Inverse Gamma Table Values');

% (We make invGamTables with more than 8 bits of resolution because some of
% the frame buffers we have in the lab are 10 bits.)

%% Invert the gamma table
% The function ieLUTLinear inverts the gamma table. It produces its output
% in the integer range that was specified at display calibration time, but
% doesn't round.
intensity = (.1:.2:.9);
fb = round(ieLUTLinear(intensity, invGamTable));

% Now, let's see how well we did. Here are the intensities we will obtain
% with these frame buffer values.
obtainedIntensity = monitorGam(fb,1);

% We can plot the obtained and desired intensities in a graph We are close,
% but because of the quantization of the device we do not obtain the exact
% linear intensities.
plot(intensity, obtainedIntensity, 'o', intensity, intensity,'-'); grid on
axis equal, axis square, axis tight
set(gca,'xtick',(0:.2:1),'ytick',(0:.2:1))
%identityLine = line([0 1],[0 1]);
legend('Obtained Intensity', 'Ideal Intensity', 'Location', 'NorthWest');
title('Ideal vs Obtained Intensity');

%% Computing xy-chromaticity coordinates
%
% The monitor is also described in terms of several different chromaticity
% coordinate measurements, namely its "white point" and the gamut of colors
% that it can reach.  The white point is the chromaticity coordinates of
% the display when all three phosphors are set to maximum intensity.  These
% can be computed as
whitePoint = chromaticity(sum(maxXYZ, 2)')';

% The (x,y) chromaticity coordinates of the phosphors can be computed
% individually as
xyMonitor = chromaticity(maxXYZ')';

% We can build a graph describing the chromaticity coordinates of the
% phosphors and the white point by first computing the xy coordinates of
% the spectrum.  Remember that the rows of xyz contain the XYZ values of
% each spectral light.  So, we can compute the chromaticity of the spectral
% lights as
xySpectrum = chromaticity(XYZ)';

% Now, we plot these values and turn on hold.  Any light is a mixture of
% spectral lights, so these values define an outer boundary for where any
% physical light can fall.
plotSpectrumLocus;  % Read this routine
axis equal, axis square
grid on, xlabel('x-chromaticity'), ylabel('y-chromaticity')
title('Spectrum Locus (gamut of visible light)');
hold on

% Overlay the xy coordinates of the three monitor phosphors on top of the
% graph
plot(xyMonitor(1,1),xyMonitor(2,1),'ro');
plot(xyMonitor(1,2),xyMonitor(2,2),'go');
plot(xyMonitor(1,3),xyMonitor(2,3),'bo');

% And place a patch over the region where sums of the phosphors can fall.
% This is called the "gamut" of the display
p = patch(xyMonitor(1,:), xyMonitor(2,:), [.5 .5 .5]);

% Finally, add in the chromaticity coordinate of the white point and label
% the axes.
plot(whitePoint(1),whitePoint(2),'wo');
xlabel('x chromaticity'), ylabel('y chromaticity')
hold off

% To plot gamut for a display, we can simply call
displayPlot(d, 'gamut');

% Notice that the white point coordinates are not at the middle of the
% gamut. The position of the white point depends on the sum of the (X,Y,Z)
% values from each of the phosphors.  These are unequal, with the green and
% blue being the largest.  Hence, the white point is closer to these two
% corners of the gamut
sum(maxXYZ)

%% TUTORIAL QUESTIONS
%
% USING THE COLOR MATCHING FUNCTIONS
%
% Consider a color matching experiment using a CRT monitor with phosphor
% spectral power distributions (SPD) given by 'phosphors' in
% cMatch/monitor.mat
%
% a) Using the CIE-XYZ method, calculate what phosphor intensities you will
% need to match a monochrome light at 550nm.  What phosphor intensities are
% needed to match a monochrome light at 430nm?
%
% b) Plot the SPD of the phosphors that would make this match.  Why are
% these intensities not physically realizable?
%
% c) If you wanted to perform an experiment to test the predicted match,
% what could you do to arrange the viewing conditions?
%
% COLOR MONITOR CALIBRATION AND CHROMATICITY
%
% a) Let the SPDs of the three phosphors of a color monitor be R, G, and B.
% Let the value of a pixel be written as a vector x = [r,g,b], where r, g,
% and b are between 0 and 1.
%
% Write the matrix equation that expresses the SPD of a monitor pixel
% displaying the pixel x.  (Ignore gamma correction)
%
% b) How do the set of spectral power distributions emitted from a pixel
% compare with the spectral power distributions that are possible in the
% environment?
%
% c) Typical monitors can modulate the linear phosphor intensity at 256
% levels (8-bits). Suppose that you could modulate the phosphor intensities
% at 16-bit accuracy. Would this monitor produce better images?  If you are
% not sure, then state what you need to know about the human visual system
% to decide whether the improvement is worthwhile.
%
% d) Suppose that you are able to build a monitor with a fourth phosphor,
% not just the three that are usually built. In what sense would this
% monitor be better than a three-primary monitor?  If you could set the x-y
% chromaticity of the phosphor, how would you design it to achieve the best
% monitor performance?  You may want to sketch or plot a chromaticity
% diagram to show what you mean.
%
%% Optional questions
% 
% Suppose you are an LCD manufacturer, and you know that if you had an
% ideal LCD, each of the R,G,B color channels would emit light according to
% the SPD given in monitors.mat.  We have already plotted the color gamut
% of such a monitor.
%
% In a real LCD display, the LC gates are not able to block 100% of the
% light from the backlight.  Suppose that due to such leakage, the contrast
% ratio between a fully black and fully white display is 100:1. Plot the
% gamut of colors for this display and explain what happens.
